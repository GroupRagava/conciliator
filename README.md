refine_viaf
===========

refine_viaf implements a [VIAF](http://viaf.org) (Virtual
International Authority File) Reconciliation Service for
[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org). This is used for resolving many
types of names (ie. persons, organizations, geographic regions) to
standard IDs representing those entities.

This project was rewritten in Java in Dec 2015. For more info, see
[this page](http://codefork.com/blog/index.php/2015/12/10/a-major-update-to-refine-viaf/). The
old version written in Python is no longer being maintained, but can
be found in the
[python-deprecated branch](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/refine_viaf/tree/python-deprecated).

Features
--------

* Support for the following types of names provided by VIAF: Corporate
  Names, Geographic Names, Personal Names, Works, Expressions

* "Through mode" to reconcile names directly to source IDs instead of
  VIAF IDs (currently only supported for BNE, BNF, DNB, JPG, LC, NDL,
  SELIBR, SUDOC, and WKP)

* Good performance (uses threads; stable memory usage; caches results)

* Super easy to run

Public Server
-------------

If your needs are low and you can't or don't want to run this software
yourself, you can use the public server at
<http://refine.codefork.com/>. Visit that address for more
instructions.

Running the Service on Your Computer
------------------------------------

Install Java 1.7 or greater if you don't already have it.

Download the .jar file for the
[latest release](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/refine_viaf/releases). Alternatively,
you can download the source code tarball or clone this repository, and
build the .jar file using maven.

Run this command:

```
java -jar refine_viaf-1.1.jar
```

That's it! You should see some messages as the application starts
up. Now you're ready to configure OpenRefine to use the service. When
you're done with it, hit Ctrl-C to quit the application.

Configuring OpenRefine
----------------------

1. In OpenRefine, chose a column of names you want to reconcile, and
   select "Reconcile" and "Start Reconciling..." in the column
   pull-down menu.

2. Click "Add Standard Service..."

3. To reconcile against names from any VIAF source, type in:

    ```
    http://localhost:8080/reconcile/viaf
    ```

    To reconcile against a specific VIAF source, append its code to
    the end of the path. For example, to search only names from the
    Biblioth√®que nationale de France, type in:
    
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/reconcile/viaf/BNF
    ```

    To use "through mode" and retrieve specific source IDs rather than
    VIAF IDs. For example, to get Library of Congress IDs for names,
    type in (note that, in this mode, the source ID at the end is
    required):
    
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/reconcile/throughviaf/LC
    ```

4. Follow the instructions on the dialog box to start reconciling
   names.

Advanced Usage
--------------

To build from the source code, install maven and type:

```
mvn package
```

If you want to host this software on a server for long-term usage or
if you want to enable logging for debugging purposes, take a look at
`run.sh` for some helpful options.

You can change several run-time options (including the service name
that appears in OpenRefine and turning caching on/off) by editing the
`refine_viaf.properties` file.
